Spaghetti, spaghetti, spaghetti. We hackers can't get enough of it.

So much so that some us decided to make self-replicating spaghetti. Spaghetti code that is.

### ✓
The code on screen is a quine that produces the image to the left. See any similarities? (Show terminal on right with code + output of code on left)

### ✓
That's because a quine is a program that prints itself. (Show slide with example quine) 

### ✓
Now you'll notice there's some actual python code spread throughout this program. (Go back to terminal with output)

What happens if we try to run this code? Well let's see. We'll run a program called quinception.py, which conveniently contains all of the code in the image from before.

This is what we end up with (Show terminal input and output). Notice how the code is the same as what is outputted, making this a quine as well.

If you look closer at the code, you'll see an example of some of the finest, red-bull induced, sleep deprived, error prone, barely comprehensive, bug-ridden, overengineered, spaghetti code. (Zoom into the code intensely as you say each of these things, add more if needed)

Spaghetti code within spaghetti code? Just like how mama made it.
